# hyperstack-viewer
Script for viewing FLUMIAS Tiff stacks and generating ROIs for amyloplasts based on segmentation of YOLOv5 detections.
## Features
* Visualization of Tiff stacks with multiple z-Layers and t-frames
* Implementation of various image processing techniques for adjusting the images before detection
* Detection of amyloplasts using pretrained YOLOv5 models followed by image segmentation
* Visualization and modification of detected plastids
* Export the generated predictions as ROI .zip
